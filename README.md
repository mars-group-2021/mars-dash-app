# Description
This repository contains all of the files required to deploy the HRVY Dash
application on Heroku. The python file must be renamed app.py for deployment,
however ongoing development prohibits this naming convension within the repository.

requirements.txt contains all dependencies needed for the app to run properly
may install all requirements locally using:
  $pip install -r requirements.txt

runtime.txt specifies Python version 3.7.10
The application does not run properly using older versions of Python
